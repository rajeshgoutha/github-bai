During its parabolic rise in price about 2 years ago, I wrote several articles urging investors to take some chips off the table, and then when it hit some low points, I suggested it might be time to buy the stock, which I did, but not just for my growth portfolio. The stock seemed to have become a value stock with a rather strong dividend, so I placed it in 3 of my portfolios, and have held it ever since in 2 of the 3 portfolios I currently manage.\n",

    "+ It is also possible to assign default values to parameters in order to make the program flexible and not behave in an unexpected manner.\n",

This feature becomes extremely important when dealing with lists or input data where you do not know number of data observations before hand.\n",
